Deep decarbonization is critical to avoiding severe climate change scenarios.
Williams et al (2012) argue, as others have done, that widespread electrification is needed to achieve decarbonization.
Our results suggest that electrification of building heating could increase peak electricity demands, requiring some combination of increased generation, storage, and/or long-distance transmission.
