# Key Points

> IOP journals ask for "key points for potential commentary on the wider significance of your work."

1. The February 2021 cold snap in Texas was severe but not unprecedented: local return periods for extreme cold ranged from under 10 years to over 100 years
2. Because the coldest extremes coincided with Texas's population centers, the temperature-induced demand for heating across the Texas Interconnect was a 50 to 100 year event
3. Future electrification of heating may decrease total energy use but increase electricity demand during cold spells
4. Design and operation of interdependent critical infrastructure should consider the deeply uncertain distribution of future hazard, not merely the most recent events
