\begin{block}{Human Impacts}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Electricity demand would have surpassed the all-season record had generation kept up \cite{ercotpublic_outagesv1:2021}
        \item Over \SI{30000}{\mega\watt} of lost output (mostly natural gas; \cite{busby_cascadingrisks:2021}) in TX for $> \SI{2}{days}$
        \item Grid within minutes of catastrophic failure (\cref{fig:ercot-frequency})
        \item Over 100 people died \cite{mulcahy_urideath:2021}
        \item Estimated \$130 billion damages \cite{busby_cascadingrisks:2021}
        \item Electricity outages caused cascading failures of water supply and other critical infrastructure
        \item Marginalized communities disproportionately affected \cite{dobbins_blackoutdisparity:2021}
    \end{itemize}
