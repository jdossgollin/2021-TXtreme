    We analyze \emph{inferred heating demand per capita} to understand the potential impacts of historic cold snaps if they occurred with today's population.

                (a): time series of annual maximum \emph{inferred heating demand per capita}.
                (b): the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) intervals, estimated using 1950-2020 data, overlaid by annual maxima from 1989, 2011, and 2021.
                Each dashed line shows a single return level (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 year) for \emph{inferred heating demand per capita} averaged over a given duration ($x$-axis).
                Gray dashed lines indicate 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 year return levels.
