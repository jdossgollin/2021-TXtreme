Less than two weeks ago, a severe cold snap left millions of Texans without water and/or power.
Already, the state legislature is investigating the causes of this event and seeking ways to mitigate future emergencies.
This article uses widely used statistical methods to assess the contribution of temperature to the  cascading infrastructure failures that took place.
Although it was a human infrastructure system that failed, not a natural system, the question of whether this event could have been anticipated has significant and immediate policy relevance.
We hope that accurate and clear science can have a role in informing ongoing policy discussions, even as we defer to future research questions around how cold extremes may change in the future or how the specific vulnerabilities of the energy and electricity systems can be addressed.
